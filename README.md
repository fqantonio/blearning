## Description
The bLearning environment was produced during the 2020 pandemic with one calleague of mine David Rodrigues, expert in Physics computing, 
that made the video content production. The eLearning enviroment uses MOODLE lesson activities mixture with h5p questions embeded in the video lessons. The lessons are for profissional school students to learn Computer architecture. The age is about 14 years mainly males, wuth to females in the 24 students. 

## Strategies:
1. Game enviroment with four levels of challenges;
2. Promoting practice along with simulation;
3. Dossier for content and conlcusion registering;
4. Use 4C/ID Inductive methodology educational.

## Conclusion
The two major conclusions:
1. Implement it if you have a team, because its very dificult to implement it alone, under the fact that you need three major roles:
   content producer, quality control, assessment;
